# Image-Classification-with-Neural-Networks

Built and compared CNN and MLP models to classify images from a subset of CIFAR-10 dataset.

Built a custom dataset pipeline and implemented efficient data loaders using PyTorch.

Designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for image classification.

Optimized models using Adam optimizer, cross-entropy loss and achieved best accuracy of 78.7%.
